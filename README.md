=======================

Integration examples of Famo.us + AngularJS

##Running
run `npm install` to fetch package dependencies

Then either:
* run `gulp` to start express server on port 4000 (by default)
* or run `gulp dev` *from the main famous-angular repo* (more instructions in its [README.md](https://github.com/Famous/famous-angular/blob/master/README.md)).  This option will autoreload the examples project when any changes are made to the core famous-angular library.

Load http://localhost:4000 in your browser.

####Troubleshooting
If nothing loads try changing the default server port in gulpfile.js and re-run `gulp`.
